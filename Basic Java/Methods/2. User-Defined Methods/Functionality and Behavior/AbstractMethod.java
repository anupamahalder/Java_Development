/**
 * We use an abstract class Vehicle with an abstract method startEngine(), 
 * which will be implemented differently in Car and Bike.
 * 
    âœ” Vehicle is an abstract class with startEngine() as an abstract method.
    âœ” Car and Bike implement startEngine() differently.
    âœ” stopEngine() is a concrete method, common to all vehicles.
    âœ” Polymorphism: We create Vehicle references (myCar, myBike) but instantiate subclasses (Car, Bike).

ðŸ”¹ Why use an abstract method?
--> It ensures that all vehicle types must define their own startEngine() method, maintaining a structured design.
