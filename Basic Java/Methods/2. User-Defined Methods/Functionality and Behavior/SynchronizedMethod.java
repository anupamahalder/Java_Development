/**
 * Explanation
    1. Shared Resource: A BankAccount object represents a shared resource.
    2. Synchronized Method: The withdraw(int amount) method is synchronized, allowing only one thread to access it at a time.
    3. Multiple Threads:
        a. Three threads (Customer 1, Customer 2, Customer 3) try to withdraw different amounts.
        b. The synchronized method ensures that only one customer can withdraw at a time, preventing race conditions.
    4. Simulated Delay: Thread.sleep(1000) mimics the time taken for withdrawal.
    5. Balance Check: Ensures no overdrawing occurs.

/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Why Did This Happen?
--> Customer 1 started first and successfully withdrew â‚¹3000, leaving â‚¹2000 in the account.
    Customer 3 started next, found â‚¹2000 available, and successfully withdrew â‚¹2000, making the balance â‚¹0.
    Customer 2 started last, tried to withdraw â‚¹4000, but since the balance was â‚¹0, the withdrawal failed.

ðŸ”¹ Why Didn't Customer 2 Run Before Customer 3?
--> Thread execution order is unpredictable in Java. The scheduler decides which thread gets CPU time first.
    Even though c2.start() was called before c3.start(), the JVM might have picked c3 to execute first.
