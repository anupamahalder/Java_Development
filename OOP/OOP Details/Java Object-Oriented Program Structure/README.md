## 🔶 `Package → Interface → Class → Object`

This is **not code syntax**, but a **conceptual hierarchy** that shows how Java structures its components — from outermost to innermost.

---

### 🔸 1. **Package**
Think of a **package** like a folder in your computer. It **groups related classes and interfaces** together.

```java
package myschool.student; // a custom package
```

🔹 **Example:**  
`java.util` is a built-in Java package that contains utility classes like `Scanner`, `ArrayList`, etc.

---

### 🔸 2. **Interface**
An **interface** is like a contract. It defines **what methods a class should have**, but **not how they work**.

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound(); // no body
}
```

A class implements this to provide the body:

```java
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 3. **Class**
A **class** is a blueprint or template. It defines **properties (variables)** and **behaviors (methods)**.

```java
class Car {
    String color;
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving...");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔸 4. **Object**
An **object** is an **instance of a class** — a real thing created from that blueprint.

```java
Car myCar = new Car(); // object created
myCar.color = "Red";
myCar.drive();
```

### 🔁 Summary in Real World Analogy:

| Java Concept | Real-Life Example |
|--------------|------------------|
| Package      | Folder (Books on subjects) |
| Interface    | Rules (Table of contents or curriculum) |
| Class        | Book (with detailed content) |
| Object       | Your personal copy of the book |
