üöÄ Inter-Thread Communication using notifyAll() in Java  
üîπ notifyAll() ‚Üí Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object's monitor.  
üîπ Used when multiple threads need to be notified at once instead of just one (notify()).

üåç Real-World Example: Restaurant Order System
üí° Scenario:
- Multiple customers (Consumer threads) are waiting for their orders.  
- A chef (Producer thread) prepares the order and notifies all waiting customers when it's ready.

üõ† Explanation:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Restaurant Class (Shared Resource)
   - prepareFood() ‚Üí Chef prepares food, then calls notifyAll() to wake up all waiting customers.  
   - serveFood() ‚Üí Customers wait for food (wait()). Once notified, they receive their meal.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ Chef (Producer)  
   - Starts preparing food, sleeps for 2 seconds to simulate cooking time.  
   - Calls notifyAll() to wake up all waiting customers.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Customers (Consumers)  
   - Each customer thread waits (wait()) until the food is ready.  
   - Once notified, they proceed to eat.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
‚úî wait() ‚Üí Makes a thread wait until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll().  
‚úî notifyAll() ‚Üí Wakes up all waiting threads.  
‚úî Best used when multiple consumers need to be notified at once.  
‚úî Prevents thread starvation, ensuring all waiting threads get a chance to proceed.  

üí° Why notifyAll() Instead of notify()?  
- notify() wakes only one thread (randomly chosen), while notifyAll() wakes all waiting threads.  
- If multiple consumers are waiting, notifyAll() ensures everyone gets notified when the resource is ready.
