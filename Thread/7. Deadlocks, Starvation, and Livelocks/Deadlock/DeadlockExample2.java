Deadlock (Threads Blocking Each Other Waiting for Resources)

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Example: Two People Booking Flight & Hotel
Person 1 books a flight first, then waits for a hotel.
Person 2 books a hotel first, then waits for a flight.
Both are waiting for the resource the other has â†’ Deadlock occurs!

ðŸš¨ Deadlock Happened!
- Person1 has Flight but needs Hotel.
- Person2 has Hotel but needs Flight.
- Both are waiting forever!

Expected Deadlock Output (No Progress, Stuck Forever)
- Person1 booked Flight
- Person2 booked Hotel
ðŸ”® Now, Person1 waits for hotelLock while holding flightLock.
ðŸ”® Person2 waits for flightLock while holding hotelLock.
ðŸ”® Both are stuck forever â†’ Deadlock achieved! ðŸš¨

Whatâ€™s Changed?
- Added Thread.sleep(100); after acquiring the first lock
- This increases the chance that Person1 locks flightLock and Person2 locks hotelLock before requesting the second lock.

Solution to Prevent Deadlock
1. Always Acquire Locks in the Same Order
- Ensure all threads lock flightLock before hotelLock.
2. Use tryLock() with Timeout (ReentrantLock)
- Avoids waiting forever.
