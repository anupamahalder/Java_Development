Starvation (Low-Priority Threads Never Get CPU Time)

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Example: Bank Transactions
High-priority customers keep making transactions.
Low-priority customers keep waiting and never get access.

ðŸ›‘ Low-priority customer (Normal Customer) may never run!
ðŸš¨ Solution: Use Fair Locks (ReentrantLock(true)) or Thread Scheduling.
