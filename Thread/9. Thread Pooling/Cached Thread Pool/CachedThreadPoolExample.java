/*
Cached Thread Pool (Dynamic Number of Threads)

ðŸ”¹ What is it?
Creates threads as needed.
Ideal for short-lived tasks with varying workloads.

Example: Processing tasks with a Cached Thread Pool

ðŸ”¹ Explanation
Executors.newCachedThreadPool() creates new threads as needed.
If a thread is idle, it is reused for new tasks.
Best for handling unpredictable workloads.
