/*
Fixed Thread Pool (Limited Number of Threads)

ðŸ”¹ What is it?
Creates a fixed number of threads.
Ideal for scenarios where the number of tasks is predictable.

Example: Processing 5 tasks with a Fixed Thread Pool

ðŸ”¹ Explanation
A fixed pool of 3 threads is created using Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3).
5 tasks are submitted. Since we have only 3 threads, tasks execute in batches.
executor.shutdown() ensures the thread pool stops after completing all tasks.
