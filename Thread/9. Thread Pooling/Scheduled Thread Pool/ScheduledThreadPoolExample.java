/*
Scheduled Thread Pool (Scheduled Execution)

ðŸ”¹ What is it?

Schedules tasks at fixed intervals or after delays.
Ideal for automated tasks like backups, monitoring, or reminders.

Example: Scheduling a Task with Scheduled Thread Pool

ðŸ”¹ Explanation
Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2) creates a thread pool for scheduled execution.
First task: Executes once after 2 seconds.
Second task: Repeats every 3 seconds.
Shutdown task: Stops execution after 10 seconds.
